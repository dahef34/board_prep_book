    "content": "Valvular Heart Disease Reference the 2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines Cross-section of heart pumping Let‚Äôs start by looking at the normal anatomy and the function of each part. The heart is divided into 4 chambers (2 Atrium / 2 Ventricles) with a septum dividing the right and left heart. Between the atria and ventricles lie the aptly named atrioventricular valves or the tricuspid and mitral valves. The tricuspid valve has 3 cusps as it says in the name and the mitral valve gets its name from a bishops mitre if this helps you remember it with 2 flaps. Bishops mitre At first, I mistakenly thought it was named after a miter joint where two pieces of wood are joined at an angle to form a strong joint. Either way remember that it typically has two leaflets. Cross-section of heart pumping These leafelets are attached to the papillary muscles in the ventricles by chordae tendinae as illustrated in the picture below. These connections are only in the atrioventricular valves because without them the valves would almost certainly fail with the force of blood ejection during systole. The aortic and pulmonic valves are called semilunar valves and each typically have 3 leaflets.\nCross-section of heart (labeled) 1\nThe aortic valve has 2 anterior leaflets and 1 posterior leaflet.\nThe pulmonic valve has 2 posterior leaflets and 1 anterior leaflet.\nAortic stenosis AHA Aortic Stenosis Recommendations\nAS is the most common cardiac valve lesion in the United States and as the population is living longer this surgery has become more prevalent. Up to 2% of the population can have a congenital bicuspid aortic valve which significantly increases the odds of developing stenosis and eventually needing repair. The normal valve area is 2.5 - 3.5 cm¬≤ and significant stenosis occurs \u003c 1.2 cm¬≤. Critical stenosis is \u003c 0.7 cm¬≤. Survival without surgery is estimated at 2-5 years after symptom onset. The left ventricle gets stronger and thickens due to the increasing workload of pumping blood through the stenotic valve. Eventually this concentric thickening will lead to decreased myocardial contractility and left ventricular function will become comprimised.\nInfo Aortic stenosis causes a PRESSURE overload which leads to CONCENTRIC hypertrophy.\nGoals Avoid Sinus rhythm Avoid atrial fibrillation or other SVT Avoid loss of artial kick (e.g. junctional rhythm, V-pacing) Normal HR (60 to 90 bpm) Avoid tachycardia Avoid profound bradycardia Avoid junctional rhythm Maintain afterload Avoid hypotension/hypertension Avoid sympathectomy Maintain preload Avoid hypovolemia Maintain volume status Replete hemorrhage Maintain contractility Avoid myocardial depressants Aortic regurgitation AHA Aortic Regurgitation Recommendations\nFull, Fast, Forward Aortic regurgitation / insufficiency happens when an incopetent aortic valve allows blood to come back into the heart from the aorta during diastole. It is usually linked to insidious disease processes in the elderly, but can be a consequence of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis.\nIt is divided into 4 stages:\nStage A: Patients at risk for aortic insufficiency. Stage B: Patients with progressive mild to moderate aortic insufficiency. Stage C: Patients with asymptomatic and severe aortic insufficiency Stage C1 patients have a left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 50% and mild to moderate left ventricular dilation with an end-systolic dimension less than 50 mm. Stage C2 patients have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50% and severe left ventricular dilation with an end-systolic dimension more than 50 mm or an indexed left ventricular end-systolic dimension more than 25 mm/m2. Stage D: Patients with symptomatic and severe AR. Info Aortic regurgitation causes a VOLUME overload which leads to ECCENTRIC hypertrophy.\nMitral stenosis AHA Mitral Stenosis Recommendations\nMitral stenosis is a narrowing of the mitral valve area. It is usually caused by rheumatic disease. Most patients will have another co-morbid valvular disease (aortic or mitral regurgitation)\nIt is divided into 4 stages:\nStage A: Patients at risk of MS Stage B: Patients with progressive MS (e.g. rheumatic valve changes with commissural fusion, diastolic doming of the mitral valve leaflets, mitral valve area \u003e 1.5 cm¬≤. Stage C: Asymptomatic Severe MS Mitral valve area ‚â§ 1.5 cm¬≤ Stage D: Symptomatic Severe MS Mitral valve area ‚â§ 1.5 cm¬≤ Management goals are similar to AS:\nGoals Avoid Sinus rhythm Avoid atrial fibrillation or other SVT Avoid loss of artial kick (e.g. junctional rhythm, V-pacing) Normal HR (60 to 90 bpm) Avoid tachycardia Avoid profound bradycardia Avoid junctional rhythm Maintain afterload Avoid hypotension/hypertension Avoid sympathectomy Maintain preload Avoid hypovolemia Maintain volume status Replete hemorrhage Maintain contractility Avoid myocardial depressants Mitral Regurgitation AHA Mitral Regurgitation Recommendations\nFull, Fast, Forward It is divided into 4 stages:\nStage A: At risk of MR - Mild mitral valve prolapse with normal coaptation. Stage B: Progressive MR - Severe mitral valve prolapse with normal coaptation. Stage C: Asymptomatic severe MR - Severe mitral valve prolapse with loss of coaptation or flail leaflet Stage D: Symptomatic severe MR - Severe mitral valve prolapse with loss of coaptation or flail leaflet and exertional dyspnea References By ZooFari - Own workSupporting references (cache), CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9841860¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

    "content": "Cardiac Cycle The cardiac cycle runs from the beginning of one hearbeat to the beginning of the next. The cycle begins in ventricular diastole just after the end of the t-wave on the ekg. The ventricles are passively filling with blood from the atria. The next phase (atrial systole) begins with atrial contraction which should show a p-wave on the ekg waveform. Ventricular systole quickly follows afterwards with a QRS complex now showing on the ekg waveform. Then the cycle repeats.\nWikimedia Commons https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_cycle#/media/File:2027_Phases_of_the_Cardiac_Cycle.jpg by Open Staxx Collee Cardiac Electronic Implantable Devices (CIED) CIED‚Äôs are broadly divided into the categories containing pacemakers and defibrillators. In general, devices are sensitive to electromagnetic interference so a general rule of thumb is to keep devices generating electromagnetic interference at least 15cm away from the implanted device. If the surgery or situation requires EMI generating devices within this radius, it is prudent to use a magnet to put the device into an asynchronous mode or have the device reprogrammed if the magnet does not inititate an asynchronous mode. With cautery use, risk is highest with monopolar cautery. Discuss possibility of using bipolar cautery or harmonic scalpel with surgeon. These devices should be interrogated before and after procedure to either reset state of reprogrammed device to original mode and function or to verify EMI has not affected the function of the device.\nPacemakers Indications for pacemakers include1\nSinus node dysfunction Symptomatic chronotropic incompetence Symptomatic bradycardia Unexplained syncope with inducible sinus bradycardia AV node dysfunction 3¬∞ AV block Type-II 2¬∞ block Symptomatic Type-I 2¬∞ block Symptomatic 1¬∞ block Asymptomatic 1¬∞ block with certain coexisting diseases (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, neuromuscular disease) Drug induced AV block that remains after d/c of drug Bifascicular block with: Alternating bundle branch block Time between Hib bundle potential and onset of ventricular activity \u003e 99 ms.

Often lessened by leaning forward or sitting in upright position. Pericardial friction rub A high-pitched scratchy or squeaky sound heard best at the left sternal boarder. Suggestive EKG changes Wide-spread upward concave ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression. Pericardial effusion TEE is recommended to rule out effusion and cardiac tamponade Treatment Treatment for acute pericarditis secondary to a non-viral identifiable cause is treatment of the underlying cause. For all viral and idiopathic causes a 3-armed approach is recommended with 1. NSAIDS, 2. Colchicine, \u0026 3. Corticosteroids. All treatments are aimed at relieving inflammation and pain. Although corticosteroids are controversial as they are also an independent risk factor for recurrents so their use if reserved for cases that fail NSAID and colchicine therapy.\nCardiac tamponade Cardiac tamponade is a continuation of pericardial effusion where all cardiac chambers are compromised due to the increased intracardial pressure so significantly so that venous return to the right atrium is affected. Cardiac tamponade should be suspected in patients with shock that have JVD and/or PEA.\nConstrictive pericarditis Constrictive pericarditis can be idiopathic, a sequelae of cardiac surgery or mediastinal radiation therapy, or from tuberculosis. This generally presents as diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function. Restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is more rare can originate from sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, or radiation and results in a rigid myocardium with a decrease in myocardial compliance.\nReferences ",

    "content": "Cardiomyopathy and heart failure AI generated image of elderly man with heart failure Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that affects the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively. It can be classified into several types, including:\nDilated cardiomyopathy: The heart becomes enlarged and weakened, which leads to a decrease in its ability to pump blood. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The walls of the heart muscle become thickened, which can make it harder for the heart to pump blood. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: The heart becomes stiff and unable to fill properly with blood, leading to decreased ability to pump blood. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy may include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and swelling of the legs and feet. It can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetics, viral infections, high blood pressure, and alcohol or drug abuse. Treatment options may include medications, lifestyle changes, and in severe cases, a heart transplant.\nSystolic Function The primary determinants of systolic function are cardiac output(stroke volume X heart rate) and ejection fraction(preload, afterload, contractility).\nLaw of Laplace The law of Laplace, also known as Laplace‚Äôs law, states that the pressure exerted by the walls of an organ or vessel is directly proportional to the tension of those walls and inversely proportional to the radius of the organ or vessel. In other words, it states that the internal pressure of a spherical vessel is proportional to the radius and the tension of the walls.\nWhat is the formula for cardiac output? $$CO_{[L/min]} = SV_{[L/beat]} * HR_{[beats/min]}$$ What are the factors affecting stroke volume and heart rate?

The left ventricle is usually affected and becomes enlarged and dilated. This dilation causes the walls of the ventricle to become thin and weak, making it difficult for the ventricle to contract and pump blood.\nDCM can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral infections, genetic mutations, high blood pressure, alcohol or drug abuse, and other underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and thyroid disease. The symptoms of DCM include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and swelling in the legs and feet.\nTreatment Options 1\nACE inhibitors Inhibit RAS Slow disease progression Reduce mortality Improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea ARBs If intolerant to ACE Beta blockers Reduced mortality Aldosterone inhibitors Reduce mortality Atrial natriuretic peptides Diuresis, natriuresis, and vasodilation Non-medical management Partial left ventriculectomy LVAD ICDs Pacemaker Heart transplant DCM Management Preoperative - Maintain medical therapy, treat arrhythmias, and review latest echo to assess for valvular anomaly. Intraoperative Avoid myocardial depression, maintain preload, prevent increases in afterload (SVR), avoid tachycardia, and induce slowly. If neuraxial is utilized, take care to prevent hypotension that could result in myocardial hypoperfusion. Consider arterial and central venous catheters. Etomidate is preferrable, but propofol may be useful in reducing SVR. Avoid ketamine and high doses of volatiles. Opioids may be useful in providing a balanced anesthetic. Info Predictors of poor outcomes: EF \u003c 20%, elevated LVEDP, left ventricular hypokinesia, and VT.\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a type of cardiomyopathy in which the heart muscle becomes thickened, especially the muscle of the left ventricle. This thickening can make it harder for the heart to pump blood, and can also cause obstruction of blood flow out of the heart. It‚Äôs a genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, that leads to abnormal cardiac muscle growth, and it‚Äôs the most common genetic heart disease, with prevalence of about 1 in 500 people.\nSymptoms of HCM can vary widely, and some people may not have any symptoms at all. Common symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, and an irregular heartbeat. HCM can also increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young athletes.\nTreatment options may include medications, such as beta-blockers, and in severe cases, surgery to remove a portion of the thickened heart muscle or to create a bypass around the obstruction to improve blood flow.\nRisk factors for sudden cardiac death include:\nPrevious cardiac arrest. Sponstaneous sustained VT. Family history of sudden death. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Syncope. LVH \u003e 30mm Abnormal BP response to exercise. HOCM Management Maintain adequate preload and afterload Maintain SVR Avoid sympathetic activation Reduce contractility Avoid tachycardia and maintain SR Treat hypotension with IV fluids and alpha-adrenergic agonists General anestehsia is preferrable over neuraxial to avoid sympathectomy. Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a type of cardiomyopathy in which the heart becomes stiff and unable to fill properly with blood. This leads to a decrease in the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively. Unlike dilated cardiomyopathy, the ventricles are not enlarged but rather become stiff, making it difficult for the heart to fill with blood and for the ventricles to relax.\nRCM can be caused by a variety of underlying medical conditions, including amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and certain types of cancer. It can also be caused by genetic mutations and inherited disorders. Symptoms of RCM can be similar to those of other types of cardiomyopathy, including shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and swelling in the legs and feet.\nTreatment options for RCM may include medications such as diuretics and other medications to improve heart function, and in severe cases, a heart transplant. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and quitting smoking can also help improve symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease.\nRestrictive HF Management Maintain adequate preload Maintain SVR Maintain sinus rhythm Prefer etomidate or ketamine to reduce myocardial depression References Ibrahim Rasmi Ibrahim, MBChB FRCA, Vivek Sharma, MBBS MD FRCA, Cardiomyopathy and anaesthesia, BJA Education, Volume 17, Issue 11, November 2017, Pages 363‚Äì369, https://doi.org/10.1093/bjaed/mkx022¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",
