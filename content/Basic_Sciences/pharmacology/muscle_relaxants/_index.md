Common muscle relaxants can be either depolarizing or non-depolarizing.

## Depolarizers

Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that is rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body.  It is two acetylcholine molecules linked by their acetyl groups.

## Non-depolarizers

#### Aminosteroids
Aminosteroid neuromuscular blockers include drugs such as vecuronium, rocuronium, and pancuronium. They are called aminosteroids because they are structurally similar to the steroid hormone aldosterone.

These drugs have a longer duration of action than depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine, which are rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body. Aminosteroid neuromuscular blockers are often preferred over depolarizing agents in certain situations, such as when longer periods of muscle relaxation are needed or when depolarizing agents are contraindicated (e.g., in patients with a history of malignant hyperthermia or neuromuscular disorders).

#### Benzylisoquinolones
Cisatracurium is an isomer of atracurium, another benzylisoquinolone neuromuscular blocking agent. Cisatracurium has the advantage of being less histamine-releasing than atracurium, which can be beneficial in certain patient populations such as those with asthma or allergies. Cisatracurium is also metabolized by Hofmann elimination, which results in a more predictable and consistent duration of action compared to atracurium, which is metabolized by both Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis.  Mivacurium is hydrolyzed by pseudocholinesterase.
