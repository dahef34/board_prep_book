BenzodiazepinesÂ influence the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor asÂ a positiveÂ allosteric modulator. The GABA-A receptor is a chloride-selective, ligand-gated ion channel. 

GABA-B is a G-protein coupled metabatropic receptor which is coupled to potassium channels.

The limbic system and cortex have large quantities of GABA, the most prevalent neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. As GABA has an inhibitory character, it lowers the excitability of neurons.
