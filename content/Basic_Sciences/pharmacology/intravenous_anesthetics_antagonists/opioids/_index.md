Opioids work on the receptor level by binding to specific protein receptors in the brain and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are part of the endogenous opioid system, which plays a role in regulating pain, mood, and the release of other neurotransmitters.

The most well-known opioid receptors are the mu, delta, and kappa receptors. Opioids bind to these receptors, leading to a range of effects that depend on the specific receptor and the type of opioid.

For example, mu opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, produce potent pain relief and a feeling of euphoria by increasing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as GABA, and reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate. This leads to decreased neuronal excitability and an overall reduction in the perception of pain.

In contrast, kappa opioid receptor agonists, such as dynorphin, have a more complex effect and can produce both pain relief and dysphoria. They are thought to play a role in regulating stress and anxiety and have been proposed as a potential target for the treatment of conditions such as depression and addiction.
