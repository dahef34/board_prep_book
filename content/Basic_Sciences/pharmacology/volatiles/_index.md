Inhalational anesthetics fall into two broad categories---volatile and non-volatile anesthetics.  Volatile anesthetics exist as a liquid at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure.  These include agents such as sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and halothane.  Although halothans is no longer commercially available in the United States.  Non-volatile anesthetics exist as a gas at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressures and include things such as Nitrous Oxide and Xenon.

### Volatile Anesthetics

Volatile anesthetics are highly flourinated methyl isopropyl ethers.  While the full mechanism of their action is not completely understood, they have been shown to disrupt G-protein coupled receptor lipid rafts in the CNS setting off an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately activates the GABAa receptor.  Currently used volatile anesthetics all differ by the number of flouride and chloride ions in the structure.
