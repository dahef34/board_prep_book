### Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamics is the study of pharmacologic actions in living systems or how a drug affects the body.  What does it do and how does it do it?  Some key meticrs are duration, onset, peak, therapeutic index and dose-response relationship.  The dose-response relationship is the most important pharcodynamic principle.

***Dose-Response***[^13]
```math
$$
D\ +\ R \rightleftharpoons DRC \rightleftharpoons TR
$$
```
A (D)rug combines with a (R)eceptor that forms a Drug-recepptor complex that elicits a tissue response (TR)

***Definitions***[^13] 
{{% expand title="Agonist:" %}}
"An agonist is a substance that binds to a specific receptor and triggers a response in the cell."[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Antagonist:" %}}
"An antagonist is a drug that has affinity for the receptor but no efficacy.  It does not activate the receptor to produce a physiologic action.  They typically have a higher affinity for the receptor than agonists."[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Potency:" %}}
Potency refers to a dose of a drug required to produce maximal effect.  The more potent drug will produce the same effect at a lower dose.[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Efficacy:" %}}
"Efficacy refers to the drugs ability to produce the desired response that is expected by stimulation of that receptor"[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Tachyphylaxis:" %}}
"A reduction in efficacy with repeated doses of a drug."[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")

### Pharmacokinetics
The fate of the drug in the body.  What the body does to the drug.  Some key elements are uptake, metabolism, biotransformation, elimination, and context-sensitive half time.

#### Uptake
Drug absorption and uptake is a highly variable process that depends on the drug properties as well as the route of administration.  
{{< notice style="info" title="Bioavailability">}}
Bioavailibity is the fraction of the drug administered that reaches systemic circulation.
{{< /notice >}}
A drug administered IV would have 100% bioavailability.  First pass metabolism, interaction with stomach acids, alterations by intestinal floura, and incomplete absorption can all contribute to lower bioavailability when medications are administered orally although there are some exceptions.  First pass metabolism appears to be the greatest contributor to a reduction in bioavailability after oral medications are given.  Oral midazolam and oral morphine undergo the greatest amount of first pass metabolism with only 20 - 40%  reaching systemic circulation.  Although diazepam is often listed in this category as well, it still has 76% bioavailability after an oral dose which is similar to other medications with minimal first-pass metabolism.


#### Metabolism
In this context, metabolism refers to the biotransformation of chemicals in the body to facilitate excretion.  This process mainly takes place in the liver and has 3 distince phases, but not all chemicals go through each phase.

{{< notice style="blue" title="Phase I reaction">}}
Phase I reactions produce a water soluble product that is often still active and usually involves reduction, oxidation, or hydrolysis.
{{< /notice >}}
{{< notice style="yellow" title="Phase II reaction">}}
Phase II reactions make the polar molecule even larger and inactive by adding hydrophylic groups through the processes of: methylation, glucuronidation, acetylation, sulfation, or conjugation.
{{< /notice >}}
{{< notice style="green" title="Phase III reaction">}}
Phase III reactions are less common and continue the process by: ATP-binding cassette or solute carrier transporters.
{{< /notice >}}

### Protein Binding
Medications can bind to proteins in the blood.  The most common proteins to bind to are Albumin, {{< math >}}\alpha_1{{< /math >}}-acid glycoprotein, lipoproteins, and globulins.  Typically albumin binds acidic drugs and the others bind basic drugs.  Only the unbound fraction of the drug is pharmacologically active.  As a general, rule drugs that are not highly protein bound tend to penetrate tissues better but are also cleared from the body faster.  Strongly protein bound drugs present significant dosing challenges when binding protein values are altered (e.g. stress, surgery, pregnancy, liver disease, kidney disease).  Ketorolac is 99% protein bound so extra care is given to the elderly who may present with alterations in albumin levels.

#### Volume of distribution
The volume of distribution is the theoretical volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount of administered drug that is observed in the plasma.

{{< math >}}
$$
V_d = \frac{Drug\ administered}{Drug\ concentration (plasma)}
$$
{{< /math >}}

***Higher lipophilicity equates to a higher volume of distribution***


#### Quick Math Calculations
If you need a mcg/mL concentration for a solution, which is how most drugs are prepared, this is a quick calculation to easily do the math in your head each time.

1000mcg = 1mg  
1000mL = 1L  
{{< math >}}
$$
\frac{1\ mcg}{1\ mL} = \frac{1\ mg}{1 L}
$$
{{< /math >}}
These equations are equivalent.  Let's do a quick calculation for norepinephrine.  We need to make an 8 mcg/mL solution of norepinephrine for the next patient.  From the calculation above we know that we need 8 mg/L.  Norepinephrine comes in 4mg/4mL vials at my institution so I would to add 8mg(8 mL) to 1L to make 8 (mg/L | mcg/mL).  If we only want to make {{< math >}}$\frac{1}{2}${{< /math >}} a liter then we would add half the amount or 4mg(4mL). If we only want to make 250cc then we would use {{< math >}}$\frac{1}{4}${{< /math >}} that amount or 2mg(2mL).  For a 100cc bag we would use {{< math >}}$\frac{8}{10}${{< /math >}} or 0.8mg(0.8mL).
