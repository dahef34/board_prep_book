### Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamics is the study of pharmacologic actions in living systems or how a drug affects the body.  What does it do and how does it do it?  Some key meticrs are duration, onset, peak, therapeutic index and dose-response relationship.  The dose-response relationship is the most important pharcodynamic principle.

***Dose-Response***[^13]
```math
$$
D\ +\ R \rightleftharpoons DRC \rightleftharpoons TR
$$
```
A (D)rug combines with a (R)eceptor that forms a Drug-recepptor complex that elicits a tissue response (TR)

***Definitions***[^13] 
{{% expand title="Agonist:" %}}
"An agonist is a substance that binds to a specific receptor and triggers a response in the cell."[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Antagonist:" %}}
"An antagonist is a drug that has affinity for the receptor but no efficacy.  It does not activate the receptor to produce a physiologic action.  They typically have a higher affinity for the receptor than agonists."[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Potency:" %}}
Potency refers to a dose of a drug required to produce maximal effect.  The more potent drug will produce the same effect at a lower dose.[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Efficacy:" %}}
"Efficacy refers to the drugs ability to produce the desired response that is expected by stimulation of that receptor"[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}
{{% expand title="Tachyphylaxis:" %}}
"A reduction in efficacy with repeated doses of a drug."[{{< math >}}$^1${{< /math >}}]({{< ref "#references" >}} "1")
{{% /expand %}}


### Pharmacokinetics
The fate of the drug in the body.  What the body does to the drug.  Some key elements are uptake, metabolism, biotransformation, elimination, and context-sensitive half time.

### Protein Binding
