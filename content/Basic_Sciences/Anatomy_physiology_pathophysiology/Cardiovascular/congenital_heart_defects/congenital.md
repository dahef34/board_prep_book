# Congenital heart defects




There are many different congenital heart defects that can present in a child.  Most of these conditions must be corrected in early life to allow for growth and development.  It is helpful to group them by their defining characteristics.

## ***Patent Ductus Arteriosus***[^3]

The ductus arteriosus is a vascular connection between the thoracic aorta and the pulmonary trunk.  Until birth when the lungs are first utilized, pulmonary resistance is high and this connection bypasses that system.  There are many different approaches to close a persistent patent ductus arteriosus.  The success rate of this procedure is high and is rarely associated with a long-term deficit.

## ***Tetralogy of Fallot***

READING: Cote [^3] p. 467

![Cardiac Output Factors](../../tof.svg "Tetralogy of Fallot")


Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic heart disease.  It is characterized by four main defects that work in conjunction: 
1. `Right` ventricular outflow tract obstruction
2. Ventricular septal defect
3. `Right` ventricular hypertrophy
4. Overriding aorta

Surgical repair ranges from a multi-staged approach with final repair in later childhood to a single surgery in infancy.  Either way, primary preanesthetic goals should include:
- Optimizing `right` ventricular filling
- Supporting `right` ventricular function
- Decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance
- Decreasing peak inspiratory pressures
