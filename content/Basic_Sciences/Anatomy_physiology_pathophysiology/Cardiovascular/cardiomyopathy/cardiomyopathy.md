## Cardiomyopathy and heart failure
![Ai Generated Heart Failure](../../ai_hf.png "AI generated image of elderly man with heart failure")


Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that affects the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively. It can be classified into several types, including:

- Dilated cardiomyopathy: The heart becomes enlarged and weakened, which leads to a decrease in its ability to pump blood.
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The walls of the heart muscle become thickened, which can make it harder for the heart to pump blood.
- Restrictive cardiomyopathy: The heart becomes stiff and unable to fill properly with blood, leading to decreased ability to pump blood.

Symptoms of cardiomyopathy may include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and swelling of the legs and feet. It can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetics, viral infections, high blood pressure, and alcohol or drug abuse. Treatment options may include medications, lifestyle changes, and in severe cases, a heart transplant.

### Systolic Function

The primary determinants of systolic function are cardiac output(stroke volume X heart rate) and ejection fraction(preload, afterload, contractility).  


### Law of Laplace

The law of Laplace, also known as Laplace's law, states that the pressure exerted by the walls of an organ or vessel is directly proportional to the tension of those walls and inversely proportional to the radius of the organ or vessel. In other words, it states that the internal pressure of a spherical vessel is proportional to the radius and the tension of the walls.

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a type of cardiomyopathy in which the heart becomes enlarged and weakened, leading to a decrease in its ability to pump blood effectively. The left ventricle is usually affected and becomes enlarged and dilated. This dilation causes the walls of the ventricle to become thin and weak, making it difficult for the ventricle to contract and pump blood.

DCM can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral infections, genetic mutations, high blood pressure, alcohol or drug abuse, and other underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and thyroid disease. The symptoms of DCM include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and swelling in the legs and feet.

***Treatment Options*** [^14]
1.  ACE inhibitors
    - Inhibit RAS
    - Slow disease progression
    - Reduce mortality
    - Improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea
2.  ARBs
    - If intolerant to ACE
3.  Beta blockers
    - Reduced mortality
4.  Aldosterone inhibitors
    - Reduce mortality
5.  Atrial natriuretic peptides
    - Diuresis, natriuresis, and vasodilation
6.  Non-medical management
    - Partial left ventriculectomy
    - LVAD
    - ICDs
    - Pacemaker
    - Heart transplant

#### DCM Management
1.  Preoperative - Maintain medical therapy, treat arrhythmias, and review latest echo to assess for valvular anomaly.
2.  Intraoperative 
    - Avoid myocardial depression, maintain preload, prevent increases in afterload (SVR), avoid tachycardia, and induce slowly.  If neuraxial is utilized, take care to prevent hypotension that could result in myocardial hypoperfusion.
    - Consider arterial and central venous catheters.
    - Etomidate is preferrable, but propofol may be useful in reducing SVR.
    - Avoid ketamine and high doses of volatiles.  Opioids may be useful in providing a balanced anesthetic.

Predictors of poor outcomes: EF <  20%, elevated LVEDP, left ventricular hypokinesia, and VT.

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a type of cardiomyopathy in which the heart muscle becomes thickened, especially the muscle of the left ventricle. This thickening can make it harder for the heart to pump blood, and can also cause obstruction of blood flow out of the heart. It's a genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, that leads to abnormal cardiac muscle growth, and it's the most common genetic heart disease, with prevalence of about 1 in 500 people.

Symptoms of HCM can vary widely, and some people may not have any symptoms at all. Common symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, and an irregular heartbeat. HCM can also increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young athletes.

Treatment options may include medications, such as beta-blockers, and in severe cases, surgery to remove a portion of the thickened heart muscle or to create a bypass around the obstruction to improve blood flow.

Risk factors for sudden cardiac death include:
1.  Previous cardiac arrest.
2.  Sponstaneous sustained VT.
3.  Family history of sudden death.
4.  Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
5.  Syncope.
6.  LVH > 30mm
7.  Abnormal BP response to exercise.

#### HOCM Management

- Maintain adequate preload and afterload
- Maintain SVR
- Avoid sympathetic activation
- Reduce contractility
- Avoid tachycardia and maintain SR
- Treat hypotension with IV fluids and alpha-adrenergic agonists
- General anestehsia is preferrable over neuraxial to avoid sympathectomy.

### Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a type of cardiomyopathy in which the heart becomes stiff and unable to fill properly with blood. This leads to a decrease in the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively. Unlike dilated cardiomyopathy, the ventricles are not enlarged but rather become stiff, making it difficult for the heart to fill with blood and for the ventricles to relax.

RCM can be caused by a variety of underlying medical conditions, including amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and certain types of cancer. It can also be caused by genetic mutations and inherited disorders. Symptoms of RCM can be similar to those of other types of cardiomyopathy, including shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and swelling in the legs and feet.

Treatment options for RCM may include medications such as diuretics and other medications to improve heart function, and in severe cases, a heart transplant. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and quitting smoking can also help improve symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease.

#### Restrictive HF Management
1.  Maintain adequate preload
2.  Maintain SVR
3.  Maintain sinus rhythm
4.  Prefer etomidate or ketamine to reduce myocardial depression
