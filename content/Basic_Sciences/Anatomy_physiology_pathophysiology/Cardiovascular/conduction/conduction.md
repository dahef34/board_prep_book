The cardiac cycle runs from the beginning of one hearbeat to the beginning of the next. The cycle begins in ventricular diastole just after the end of the t-wave on the ekg.  The ventricles are passively filling with blood from the atria.  The next phase (atrial systole) begins with atrial contraction which should show a p-wave on the ekg waveform.  Ventricular systole quickly follows afterwards with a QRS complex now showing on the ekg waveform.  Then the cycle repeats.

### Cardiac Electronic Implantable Devices (CIED)

CIED's are broadly divided into the categories containing pacemakers and defibrillators.  In general, devices are sensitive to electromagnetic interference so a general rule of thumb is to keep devices generating electromagnetic interference at least 15cm away from the implanted device.  If the surgery or situation requires EMI generating devices within this radius, it is prudent to use a magnet to put the device into an asynchronous mode or have the device reprogrammed if the magnet does not inititate an asynchronous mode.  With cautery use, risk is highest with monopolar cautery.  Discuss possibility of using bipolar cautery or harmonic scalpel with surgeon.  These devices should be interrogated before and after procedure to either reset state of reprogrammed device to original mode and function or to verify EMI has not affected the function of the device.

#### Pacemakers

1.  Sinus node dysfunction
