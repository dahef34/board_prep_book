## Cardiovascular and peripheral vascular complications

# Cardiac System

The cardiac system consists of the heart and the blood vessels and is responsible for delivering nutrients to the body and removing waste products.

## Hypertension

### Classification [^16]
|Classification	     | SBP	   | DBP     |
| ------------       | ------  | ------  |
| Normal	         | <120	   | < 80    |
| Prehypertension	 | 120‚Äì129 | < 80    |
| Stage 1     	     | 130‚Äì139 | 80‚Äì89   |
| Stage 2	         | ‚â• 140   | ‚â• 90    |


## Heart Disease

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. [^15]


## DVT / PE

There is an up to five-fold increase in PE after surgery.  The highest risk categories are for hip fracture repairs and spinal cord injuries.[^17]  Other major risk factors include:
1.  Hereditary
    - Factor deficiencies (Antithrombin, Protein C/S, prothrombin)
    - Factor V Leiden
2.  Medications
    - Hormone replacement therapy
    - OCPs
    - Chemotherapy
    - Antiphyshotics
    - Heparins
3.  Surgery
    - Open abdominal procedures
    - Throacic procedures
    - Hip or leg Fractures
    - Hip or knee replacements
    - General as opposed to regional or neuraxial
4.  Acquired
    - Elderly
    - Cancer
    - Reduced mobility
    - CHF
    - Inflammatory bowel disease
    - Nephrotic syndrome
    - CVC
    - Trauma
    - Spinal cord injury
    - Obesity
    - Previous PE
    - Tobacco use

Clinical findings in patients with a PE include in descending order: dyspnea, tachycardia, acute onset, age > 65, syncope, and arterial hypotension.  A PE leads to physiologic dead space which can be calculated using the Bohn equation:

```math
$$V_{d\ phys} = V_T[(PaCO_2 - PeCO_2)/PaCO_2]$$
```

Angiography and spiral or helical CT scanning are the gold standard for detecting a CT.[^17]  V/Q scans, echocardiography, chest x-ray, and blood tests such as d-dimer or ELISA have shown conflicting results and should not be first line unless other options are not feasible.

#### PE management

Typically patients are manged with pharmacologic treatment and/or mechanical prophylaxis such as an IVC filter.  IVC filters are controversial and problematic since they tend to be less efficacious than pharmacologic prophylaxis and there is an increased incidence of recurrent DVT with their use.
