#### By AnestheTIPS

In this review, we will walk you through some of the topics on the National Certification Exam.  This review is a work in progress with content continually being added so check back often for more content.  My vision for this review is to be a crowd-sourced, curated, and documented reference to use for your studies.  If you would like to contribute to this shared online knowledge base, send an email to [justin@anesthe.tips](mailto:justin@anesthe.tips) and let me know that you're interested.  Student submissions are welcome as well!

### What this review is not
- Complete.  We cover most of the content on the NCE, but we are not rewriting a textbook.  You will need to have read and digested the content listed on the bibliography.
- A replacement for dedicated content review applications (Apex, Prodigy, Valley)
- A sole source of study content.

### How to study
We know things like rereading and highlighting the textbook ***do not*** help that much with retention of the knowledge when used as the sole study technique.  Am I saying that you don't need to read the text? Absolutely not! You need to read the text with purpose to get the most out of your studies and I'll briefly go over some techniques to help you.

#### What works?
The two main methods to enhance retention of the content are [spaced repitition](https://e-student.org/spaced-repetition/) and [active recall](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2022/02/21/active-recall-the-most-effective-highyield-learning-technique).  To use these concepts requires some knowledge of the concepts when you are reading the textbook.  My recommendation is to utilize flash cards to learn the content.  You can buy commercial flash cards from different publishers, but I think it is really better if you make your own.  I know this is a lot of work, but it is worth the effort if you want to pass the NCE on the first attempt.  As you read the textbook take notes and make flashcards from the concepts that you need to remember.  On these flashcards have 3 distinct sections. 

1. Summary
  - Summarize the concept in your own words.  It needs to use your words, not necessarily the textbook definition.  Don't use superfluous words and make the definition concise and to the point.
2. Examples
  - If you have clinical anchors for the topic, write them down.  The more memories that you can link to the concept the better chance you will remember it.  If you don't have any clinical examples then textbook examples will suffice.
3. Picture
  - Draw a picture of the concept.  You don't have to be a great artist and the picture doesn't even have to make sense to anybody but you.  If you can't think of anything to draw, just pick something, anything, and draw it.  This is just one more way for your brain to link the information to a memory so your brain is more likely to hold on to this information.

### Feynman technique
Once you feel like you have the concept down, use the feynman technique to really develop the topic.  This process has 4 basic parts.

1.  Study
  - You've already done this at this point.  Know everything you can about the topic.  One thing that can help is to search the topic online to see what comes up.  You aren't really looking for information on the topic, just anchors to connect the information to.  For example, maybe when you are studying Parkinson's disease and anesthesia, you look up a [stody about Michael J. Fox having surgery](https://people.com/tv/michael-j-fox-opens-up-about-painful-injuries-recovery-and-kind-acts-that-changed-his-life/) and read that for perspective and a few more anchors in your brain.  These memories are like a tree and the clinical anchors are roots.  The more roots that you develop, the more likely the tree (information) is going to survive.  Make your flashcards!  To really retain the information, I recommend studying these flashcards using a spaced repitition algorithm.  If you read the title of the flashcard and can't remember anything about it, look at the information again in an hour, and then the next day.  If you know the information like the back of your hand, maybe a few days or a week can go by before you look at it again.  The less confident that you feel on the topic, the more you should be looking at it.
2.  Teach
  - Find someone that you can teach the subject to.  This can be your spouse, a friend, a family member, or a random person that you meet.  It doesn't really matter, but it should be someone that is not familiar with the topic.  This is important because you really want them to ask you the most annoying question in the world at times......Why?  If you can't explain something simply, then you probably don't know it well.  You can read the textbook to an expert and they won't find anything wrong with what you are saying, but that doesn't mean you know it.  If you can break down the topic to it's most fundamental concepts and explain it to anyone then you truly know it.  You didn't just memorize the definition.  The NCE tests higher-order knowledge and you need to be able to apply it to a wide range of clinical situations.  Being able to recite a definition doesn't give you the fundamental knowledge to be able adapt your thinking in the higher-order questions to come to the right answer.  Making a video on the topic is another way to go.  Record a video of yourself going over the topic and rewatch it.  Did you cheat and look at your notes?  Did you have to think about what you were saying so much that your deliver was choppy and disjointed?  Could you show it to someone in the medical field and they understand what you are saying?  You can always joing our {{% button href="https://discord.gg/hfQTBwPMNB" color="purple" icon="fab fa-discord" %}}Discord{{% /button %}} server and teach someone in the study lounge.

3.  Refine
  - Hopefully when you were teaching someone, they gave you things to think about and poked holes in your logic and arguments.  This is good because it helps to find the weak spots in your knowledge base.  Go back to the textbook or search the literature to shore up the areas that you were weak in.
4.  Simplify
  - You need to make your working definition or explanation of the topic as concise and simple as possible.  This makes it easier to remember and understand.
  - > Any fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius-and a lot of courage-to move in the opposite direction.  --Albert Einstein

  - > The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.  --Thomas Jefferson
  - These are a few of my favorite quotes on brevity.  It's hard but a necessary step if you want to truly know something.

Once you've finished the process, use the spaced repitition technique to revisit the topic periodically so you cement the knowledge deep within yourself.  There is no worse feeling than spending hours, days, and weeks learning a topic to only go completely blank on the test.  You know it's in there somewhere, you just can't remember it.  Revisiting the topic periodically gives a signal to your brain that this information is important and it needs to be kept in a state that is easily recallable.

### Should you study the content in order?
The short answer here is no.  The concepts are listed in the same order as the NCE content outline.  My suggestion would be to ***[eat the frog](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog)***.  Pick the hardest concept to you and tackle that.  After that, pick the next one and move on down the line.   


With that being said, our goal is to give you a different perspective and another opportunity to review the content from another angle.  Use this review as a supplement to your education.
